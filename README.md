This is a mobile application made with Flutter that uses 42's REST API to display any student's information. It has one view to search by login and a second to display all the details:
- Full name
- Profile picture
- Campus location
- Current level
- All projects completed with their score
- Skill levels

Requires a .env with the FORTYTWO_UID and FORTYTWO_SECRET from your 42 API application.
